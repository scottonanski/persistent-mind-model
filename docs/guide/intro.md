# Persistent Mind Model (PMM)

A high-level mental model of the system that logs events, reflects, tracks commitments, and exposes a Probe API for observability. This documentation site consolidates the scattered markdown files into a coherent guide.

- What: A Python library + API for persistent cognitive logs and analysis
- UI: A Flutter client for monitoring and (soon) chatting
- Why: Make AI agents inspectable, measurable, and improvable over time
