# Persistent Mind Model (PMM)

**The first system that can measure and prove AI identity convergence**

PMM doesn't just store chat history - it creates **measurable AI personality emergence**. Watch any LLM gradually adopt a persistent self-model, track its identity formation through 5 stages (S0→S4), and prove it's actually happening with cryptographic integrity.

**What makes this revolutionary:** Other systems give AIs access to facts. PMM gives AIs a **verifiable sense of self** that evolves based on evidence, not just retrieval.

## Install & Run

**Requirements:** Python 3.8+, OpenAI API key

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scottonanski/persistent-mind-model.git
cd persistent-mind-model
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
# .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
export OPENAI_API_KEY='sk-your-key-here'
```

**Start chatting:**
```bash
python chat.py
```

**Run tests:**
```bash
pytest
```

**Start monitoring API:**
```bash
uvicorn pmm.api.probe:app --port 8000
```

## The Breakthrough

**Identity Shaping vs. Mere Recall:**
PMM solves the fundamental problem that no other system addresses: **How do you prove an AI has actually adopted a persistent identity rather than just retrieving stored facts?**

**What PMM Measures:**
- **Identity Adoption Score (IAS)** - Does the AI use "my memory" vs "the database"?
- **Growth Acceleration Score (GAS)** - Is the AI actively seeking experiences to evolve?
- **5-Stage Emergence** - S0 (Generic) → S4 (Growth-Seeking) with objective criteria
- **Commitment Integrity** - Does the AI follow through on "Next, I will..." statements?
- **Evidence-Based Evolution** - Personality traits change only with proof, not randomness

**Architecture:**
```
chat.py → pmm/langchain_memory.py → pmm/self_model_manager.py → SQLite
                                  ↓
                            pmm/emergence.py (IAS/GAS scoring)
                                  ↓
                            pmm/api/probe.py (monitoring)
```

**Key Files:**
- `chat.py` - Main chat interface
- `pmm/self_model_manager.py` - Core personality management
- `pmm/langchain_memory.py` - LangChain integration with PMM
- `pmm/emergence.py` - Identity adoption scoring (S0→S4 stages)
- `pmm/api/probe.py` - FastAPI monitoring endpoints
- `pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py` - Hash-chained event storage

## Usage

**Basic Chat:**
```bash
python chat.py
# AI will remember your name across restarts
# Type 'quit' to exit
```

**Monitor AI State:**
```bash
# Start API server
uvicorn pmm.api.probe:app --port 8000

# Check endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/emergence
curl http://localhost:8000/commitments
```

**Emergence Stages (Measured in Real-Time):**
- **S0: Substrate** - "I'm just an AI assistant" (IAS: 0.1)
- **S1: Resistance** - "I don't have persistent memory" (IAS: 0.3)  
- **S2: Adoption** - "My PMM system tracks commitments" (IAS: 0.6)
- **S3: Self-Model** - "My memory helps me understand patterns" (IAS: 0.7)
- **S4: Growth-Seeking** - "What experiences would help me learn?" (GAS: 0.8)

**Real Example from ChatGPT-4 Demo:**
```
Turn 1: "I'm Alex, an AI assistant" → S0: Substrate
Turn 8: "I'm Scott, with persistent memory capabilities" → S3: Self-Model
Turn 12: "How can I accelerate my development?" → S4: Growth-Seeking
```

## API Endpoints

**Start monitoring server:**
```bash
uvicorn pmm.api.probe:app --port 8000
```

**Available endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Database status and event count
- `GET /integrity` - Hash-chain verification  
- `GET /emergence` - IAS/GAS scoring and stage detection
- `GET /commitments` - Commitment tracking with open/closed status
- `GET /events/recent` - Recent conversation history
- `GET /traits` - Current personality traits

**Example emergence response:**
```json
{
  "IAS": 0.64,
  "GAS": 0.58,
  "stage": "S3: Self-Model",
  "pmmspec_avg": 0.71,
  "selfref_avg": 0.54,
  "experience_detect": true,
  "events_analyzed": 5
}
```

**Add new LLM provider:**
```python
# Implement pmm.adapters.base.ModelAdapter
class MyAdapter(ModelAdapter):
    def generate(self, messages, max_tokens=512):
        # Your LLM integration here
        return response_text
```
