"""Kernel orchestrator for PMM runtime.

Purpose:
- Coordinate high-level operations across storage (event log), commitments,
  LLM factory/adapters, bridge styling, and the unified runtime loop.
- Enforce core invariants defined in `pmm/core/invariants.py`.

This is a placeholder skeleton; concrete orchestration logic will be added
in later steps of the refactor.
