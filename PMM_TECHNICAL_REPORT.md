# Persistent Mind Model (PMM) - Technical Report

**A Comprehensive Analysis of Architecture, Implementation, and Functionality**

---

## Executive Summary

The Persistent Mind Model (PMM) is an AI personality system for maintaining consistent, evolving personalities across conversations and sessions. Built on a production-oriented foundation with experimental next-stage features, PMM focuses on identity integrity, evidence-weighted personality drift, and cross-platform portability.

---

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Core Purpose
PMM solves the fundamental problem of AI personality persistence by providing:
- **Memory continuity** across conversations and sessions
- **Personality evolution** based on evidence-weighted behavioral changes
- **Cryptographic integrity** for tamper-evident AI memory history
- **Cross-platform portability** enabling AI identity migration

### 1.2 Architecture Philosophy
The system follows a layered architecture approach, building from a solid foundation of personality modeling to advanced features like a memory token state model (amplitude/phase) and local inference capabilities. Note: any 'quantum' terminology is metaphorical. See `pmm/quantum_memory.py`; implementation uses classical heuristics. This design ensures backward compatibility while enabling experimental features.

## 2. Core Architecture - 7-Layer System

### Layer 1: Foundation Integration

**Purpose:** Provides the base personality modeling system with psychological grounding.

**Key Components:**
- `pmm/model.py` - Core dataclasses defining the personality structure
- `pmm/self_model_manager.py` - Original PMM manager (22KB of production code)
- `pmm/enhanced_manager.py` - Extended manager integrating all 7 layers

**How it Works:**
The foundation layer implements the Big Five personality model (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) as quantifiable traits that can evolve over time. Each AI agent maintains:
- **Events** - Significant experiences with timestamps and context
- **Thoughts** - Internal reflections triggered by events
- **Insights** - Higher-level understanding derived from patterns
- **SelfKnowledge** - Comprehensive personality state including traits and memories

**Data Structure Example:**
```python
@dataclass
class SelfKnowledge:
    personality_traits: Dict[str, float]  # Big Five scores 0.0-1.0
    insights: List[str]
    behavioral_patterns: List[str]
    identity_evolution: List[str]
    commitment_close_rate: float
```

### Layer 2: Memory Tokenization

**Purpose:** Creates cryptographically verifiable memory tokens with blockchain-style integrity.

**Key Components:**
- `pmm/tokenization_engine.py` - SHA-256 hash chain creation
- `pmm/memory_token.py` - MemoryToken dataclass with amplitude/phase state fields

**How it Works:**
Every memory (event, thought, insight) gets converted into a MemoryToken with:
1. **Content hash** - SHA-256 of the memory content
2. **Previous hash** - Links to the previous token in the chain
3. **Timestamp** - When the memory was created
4. **State model** - Amplitude and phase values for memory dynamics

The tokenization process creates an immutable chain where any tampering breaks the cryptographic verification, similar to blockchain technology but optimized for individual AI memory rather than distributed consensus.

**Token Creation Process:**
```python
def create_memory_token(self, event: Event, previous_hash: str) -> MemoryToken:
    content_hash = hashlib.sha256(event.summary.encode()).hexdigest()
    chain_hash = hashlib.sha256(f"{previous_hash}{content_hash}".encode()).hexdigest()
    
    return MemoryToken(
        content_hash=content_hash,
        previous_hash=previous_hash,
        chain_hash=chain_hash,
        quantum_state=self.generate_quantum_state(event)
    )
```

### Layer 3: Memory token state model (amplitude/phase)

Note: 'quantum' terminology is metaphorical. See `pmm/quantum_memory.py`. Implementation uses classical heuristics for salience (amplitude) and semantic angle (phase).

**Key Components:**
- `pmm/quantum_memory.py` - Amplitude/phase vector management

**How it Works:**
Each memory token includes state vectors:
- **Amplitude** (0.0-1.0) - Represents memory activation probability/strength
- **Phase** (0-2Ï€ radians) - Represents semantic angle in memory space
- **Temporal decay** - Memories naturally fade over time unless reinforced
- **Related-memory activation** - Heuristic activation via phase proximity

**Memory State Calculation:**
```python
def calculate_memory_resonance(self, cue_phase: float, memory_phases: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    resonance_scores = []
    for phase in memory_phases:
        # Calculate phase difference (heuristic using angle distance)
        phase_diff = abs(cue_phase - phase)
        if phase_diff > math.pi:
            phase_diff = 2 * math.pi - phase_diff
        
        # Convert to resonance score (higher = more similar)
        resonance = math.cos(phase_diff)
        resonance_scores.append(max(0, resonance))
    
    return resonance_scores
```

### Layer 4: Compression & Archival

**Purpose:** Manages memory growth through intelligent compression and archival.

**Key Components:**
- `pmm/archive_engine.py` - Thematic clustering and compression (23KB)

**How it Works:**
As AI agents accumulate memories, the system prevents unbounded growth through:
1. **Thematic clustering** - Groups related memories by semantic similarity
2. **Compression** - Uses GZIP/LZMA to reduce storage size by 70-90%
3. **Identity lockpoints** - Periodic full-state snapshots for integrity verification
4. **Selective archival** - Preserves important memories while compressing routine ones

The archival process maintains personality continuity while managing computational resources.

### Layer 5: Cue-Based Recall

**Purpose:** Enables semantic memory search and context-aware retrieval.

**Key Components:**
- `pmm/recall_engine.py` - Semantic memory search (22KB)

**How it Works:**
Memory recall combines multiple techniques:
1. **Embedding similarity** - Uses sentence transformers to find semantically related memories
2. **Phase heuristic** - Activation based on memory phase proximity
3. **Archive integration** - Searches both active and archived memories
4. **Relevance scoring** - Combines semantic similarity with recency and importance

**Recall Process:**
```python
def recall_memories(self, cue: str, max_results: int = 5) -> List[RecallResult]:
    # Generate embedding for the cue
    cue_embedding = self.embedding_model.encode([cue])[0]
    
    # Search active memories
    active_results = self.search_active_memories(cue_embedding)
    
    # Search archives if needed
    archive_results = self.search_archives(cue_embedding)
    
    # Combine and rank results
    all_results = active_results + archive_results
    return sorted(all_results, key=lambda x: x.similarity_score, reverse=True)[:max_results]
```

### Layer 6: Offline/Local Mode

**Purpose:** Enables AI operation without dependence on external APIs.

**Key Components:**
- `pmm/local_inference.py` - Multi-provider local LLM support (24KB)

**How it Works:**
The local inference layer provides:
1. **Multiple backends** - Ollama, LM Studio, llama.cpp, HuggingFace integration
2. **Unified interface** - Abstract away provider differences
3. **Hybrid fallback** - Try local models first, fall back to APIs if needed
4. **Performance optimization** - Model selection based on task complexity

**Provider Abstraction:**
```python
class LocalInferenceEngine:
    def __init__(self):
        self.providers = {
            'ollama': OllamaProvider(),
            'lm_studio': LMStudioProvider(),
            'llama_cpp': LlamaCppProvider(),
            'huggingface': HuggingFaceProvider()
        }
    
    def generate_text(self, prompt: str, provider_preference: List[str]) -> InferenceResult:
        for provider_name in provider_preference:
            try:
                result = self.providers[provider_name].generate(prompt)
                if result.success:
                    return result
            except Exception as e:
                continue
        
        # Fallback to API if all local providers fail
        return self.api_fallback.generate(prompt)
```

### Layer 7: Integrity & Portability

**Purpose:** Ensures complete AI identity export/import with cryptographic verification.

**Key Components:**
- `pmm/integrity_engine.py` - Export/import with verification (25KB)

**How it Works:**
The integrity layer enables:
1. **Complete export** - Full AI personality state with all memories and metadata
2. **Cryptographic verification** - Hash chain validation ensures data integrity
3. **Cross-platform migration** - Same AI identity/personality across different systems
4. **Incremental backup** - Efficient updates without full re-export

**Export Process (public API):**
```python
from pmm.enhanced_manager import EnhancedSelfModelManager

manager = EnhancedSelfModelManager(
    model_path="enhanced_pmm_model.json",
    enable_next_stage=True,
)

manifest = manager.export_identity("./my_export", include_archives=True)
print(f"Export ID: {manifest.export_id}")
print(f"Created: {manifest.created_at}")
print(f"Total tokens: {manifest.total_tokens}")
```

## 7. Performance Characteristics

### 7.1 Memory Management

- **Active Memory:** ~500 tokens (configurable)
- **Archive Compression:** 70-90% size reduction
- **Storage Growth:** Logarithmic with automatic archival

### 7.2 Response Times

Note: The following values are illustrative and depend heavily on hardware, model choice, and configuration. Measure in your environment for accurate figures.

- **Memory Recall:** Typical sub-second on local indexes
- **Chain Verification:** Scales with token count; typically fast for moderate sizes
- **Token Creation:** Dependent on hashing and I/O performance

#### 7.2.1 Benchmarks (illustrative)

To generate local, reproducible numbers on your machine:

```bash
# From repo root (light run, recall disabled by default)
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/benchmarks.py --model-path /tmp/pmm_bench_model.json --fresh

# Include recall timing (may load embedding stack depending on config)
PYTHONPATH=. python3 scripts/benchmarks.py --tokens 100 --recalls 3 --enable-recall \
  --model-path /tmp/pmm_bench_model.json --fresh
```

This reports:
- Token creation avg (ms/event)
- Recall latency avg (ms)
- Verify integrity time (ms)

Notes:
- Default token count is 50 for fast runs; increase (e.g., 100) for smoother averages.
- By default, heavy backends are disabled. Use `--enable-recall` and/or `--enable-inference` to opt-in.
- The benchmark prints periodic progress and ETA, e.g. `Â· 20/100 events | avg=42.3 ms | elapsed=0.9s | ETA=1.7s`.

Note: Results are hardware- and configuration-dependent (model/provider, CPU/GPU, disk). Treat as illustrative, not universal claims.
