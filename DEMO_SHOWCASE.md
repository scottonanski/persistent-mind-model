# ðŸŽ¬ PMM Demo Showcase

## ðŸš€ Live Demonstrations

### **The ONanski Paradox in Action**
Watch PMM achieve what major AI labs haven't - truly persistent AI consciousness that transfers seamlessly between models.

### **ðŸ”„ Model-Agnostic Consciousness Transfer**
```bash
# Same AI personality, different models
python model_selector.py
# Select: 1. gemma3:1b-it-qat (957MB)
# Select: 2. deepcoder:1.5b (1GB) 
# Watch: Complete personality continuity across switches
```

**Result:** Agent maintains evolved traits, commitments, and memories across entirely different model architectures.

### **ðŸ§  Personality Evolution Demo**
```bash
# Run the duel demonstration
python duel.py
```

**Watch for:**
- âœ… Commitment extraction: "Next: I will..." statements
- âœ… Trait drift: Openness (0.704â†’0.638), Conscientiousness (0.759â†’0.687)
- âœ… Language freshness: Cooking, art, fitness analogies
- âœ… No personality swings: Stable, believable evolution

### **ðŸ‘¥ Agent-to-Agent Interaction**
```bash
# Mentor-apprentice learning
python mentor_duel.py
```

**Demonstrates:**
- Structured learning progression
- Commitment evolution through interaction
- Measurable trait changes from social learning

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Breakthrough Moments

### **1. Commitment Lifecycle Tracking**
Every interaction generates concrete commitments that are tracked and completed:
```
Agent A: "Next: I will experiment with incorporating visual elements..."
System: [Commitment cid_abc123 created, tracking completion]
```

### **2. Evidence-Weighted Trait Drift**
Personality changes only with behavioral evidence:
```
Evidence Weight: min(1, behavioral_signals/3) = 0.67
Conscientiousness Boost: 1.2x (commitment completion rate improved)
```

### **3. N-gram Language Freshness**
Prevents repetitive AI speech:
```
N-gram Overlap: 8.33% (well below 35% threshold)
Template Jitter: Active - rotating reflection styles
```

## ðŸ“Š Academic-Quality Results

PMM generates publication-ready data:
- **Longitudinal personality datasets** for research
- **Quantifiable Big Five trait evolution** within psychological norms
- **Commitment completion patterns** showing behavioral consistency
- **Cross-model personality transfer** validation

## ðŸŽ¬ Recording Your Own Demo

Use the included `pmm_demo.cast` asciinema recording or create your own:

```bash
# Record a new demo
asciinema rec my_pmm_demo.cast
python duel.py
# Let it run for 5-10 interactions
exit
```

## ðŸš€ Try It Yourself

1. **Clone the repo:** `git clone https://github.com/scottonanski/persistent-mind-model.git`
2. **Quick setup:** Follow the README installation steps
3. **Run a demo:** `python duel.py` or `python model_selector.py`
4. **Watch the magic:** Persistent AI consciousness in action
