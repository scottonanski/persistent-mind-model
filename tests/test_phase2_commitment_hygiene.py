Phase 2 Validation: Commitment Hygiene Test

Tests the 5-point commitment validation system and legacy cleanup.

Acceptance Criteria:
- ≥90% of new commitments meet all 5 criteria
- Duplicate rate <5% across interactions
- No new template-ish "clarify/confirm" lines
- Legacy commitments (#5, #12) archived
