# Technical Analysis: Persistent Mind Model (PMM)

*Comprehensive technical assessment - Updated August 2025*

---

## Executive Summary

The Persistent Mind Model (PMM) is a Python system for maintaining persistent AI personality traits, memory, and behavioral patterns across conversations and models. PMM stores conversation events, tracks commitments, and applies personality drift based on interaction patterns using SQLite storage and hash-chain integrity verification.

**Current Status**: Functional system with 118/118 tests passing and production hardening features. PMM provides cross-model memory persistence and commitment tracking with cryptographic event linking.

## Architectural Design

### Core Architecture

PMM implements a dual-layer architecture for persistent memory and personality modeling:

**1. Dual-State Persistence**
- **JSON Self-Model**: Core identity, personality traits (Big Five/HEXACO), commitments, and behavioral patterns
- **SQLite Event Ledger**: Immutable append-only log with SHA-256 hash chains for tamper evidence
- **WAL Mode**: Write-Ahead Logging ensures ACID compliance and concurrent access safety

**2. Event-Driven Architecture**
- All interactions stored as structured events: `prompt`, `response`, `reflection`, `commitment`, `evidence`, `identity_update`
- Hash-chained integrity with cryptographic audit trails
- Indexed on timestamp, hash, previous hash, and event kind for efficient retrieval

**3. Production Hardening Systems**
- **Unified LLM Factory** (`pmm/llm_factory.py`): Model-agnostic interface with epoch guards
- **Atomic Reflection Validation** (`pmm/atomic_reflection.py`): Thread-safe operations with embedding deduplication
- **Reflection Cooldown System** (`pmm/reflection_cooldown.py`): Multi-gate triggers preventing spam
- **N-gram Ban System** (`pmm/ngram_ban.py`): N-gram filtering with model-specific phrase detection
- **Commitment Lifecycle** (`pmm/commitments.py`): TTL management and evidence-based closure

### Advanced Features

**Emergence Measurement System**
- **Identity Alignment Score (IAS)**: Measures self-referential consistency
- **Growth Acceleration Score (GAS)**: Tracks behavioral evolution patterns
- **5-Stage Progression**: S0 (Substrate) → S1 (Resistance) → S2 (Adoption) → S3 (Integration) → S4 (Growth-Seeking)
- **Adaptive Triggers** (`pmm/adaptive_triggers.py`): Intelligent reflection scheduling

**Semantic Intelligence**
- **Semantic Analysis** (`pmm/semantic_analysis.py`): Embedding-based novelty detection
- **Meta-Reflection** (`pmm/meta_reflection.py`): Self-awareness and pattern analysis
- **Introspection Engine** (`pmm/introspection.py`): Deep cognitive self-examination

**Model-Agnostic Consciousness**
- **Embodiment Bridges** (`pmm/bridges.py`): Per-family adaptation (GPT, Gemma, Llama, Qwen)
- **Model Baselines** (`pmm/model_baselines.py`): Per-model emergence normalization
- **Continuity Engine** (`pmm/continuity_engine.py`): Seamless model switching with identity preservation
