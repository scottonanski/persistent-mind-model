A “mind” shouldn’t wait for keywords. It should continuously ingest both sides of the conversation, extract structure, and update itself based on evidence. Here’s how to evolve PMM’s storage/processing to do that.

# Recommended Changes

- **Append everything, then auto-enrich**
    
    - Keep writing every turn to 
        
        events in 
        
        pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py (already good: append-only + hash-chain).
    - Add a background enrichment pipeline that triggers on each new event (user or assistant) to derive structured state.
- **Add semantic layers (new tables)**  
    In 
    
    pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py (or a new module that uses it):
    
    - **insights**: 
        
        ```
        {id, ts, event_id, kind, content, meta, prev_hash, hash}
        ```
        
          
        Derived meaning from raw text (facts, takeaways, hypotheses).
    - **commitments**: 
        
        ```
        {id, created_ts, source_event_id, text, due_ts NULL, status, meta}
        ```
        
          
        Extracted actions with lifecycle (open/closed).
    - **evidence**: 
        
        ```
        {id, ts, event_id, commitment_id, confidence, notes, meta}
        ```
        
          
        Links proof back to a commitment (not keyword-based; see below).
    - **embeddings**: 
        
        ```
        {id, object_type, object_id, model, vector_json TEXT}
        ```
        
          
        Store vectors as JSON for portability; compute cosine in Python.
- **Replace keyword heuristics with semantic similarity**
    
    - Generate embeddings for each new event and for each open commitment.
    - For each open commitment, compare against recent events.  
        If cosine similarity >= 0.70 (tunable) and a short LLM check agrees (optional), create an 
        
        ```
        evidence
        ```
        
         row and transition commitment to closed.
    - This implements the “autonomous evidence-based closure” you asked for (see 
        
        ```
        d1a6499a
        ```
        
         memory), but grounded in embeddings, not keywords.
- **Continuous insight extraction**
    
    - Each event triggers an LLM (or rule+LLM hybrid) to create one or more 
        
        ```
        insights
        ```
        
         with provenance:
        - Facts learned (entities, attributes)
        - Open questions
        - Hypotheses
        - “Tensions” or “Next experiments”
    - Link 
        
        ```
        insights.meta
        ```
        
         to 
        
        ```
        {event_ids, pattern_keys, commitment_ids}
        ```
        
         for provenance.
- **Drift gating from evidence, not words**
    
    - Trait drift (
        
        ```
        pmm/drift.py
        ```
        
        ) should consume metrics produced by enrichment: close rate, signal counts (experimentation, goal-alignment), and use the evidence-weighted formula you already standardized.
    - No direct keyword gates—only computed signals.
- **Background worker hook**
    
    - In 
        
        chat.py, you already persist context asynchronously via:
        - ```
            threading.Thread(target=_persist_context, ...)
            ```
            
    - After 
        
        ```
        save_context(...)
        ```
        
        , kick an enrichment worker:
        - ```
            auto_enrich.process_new_events(store, since_last_id)
            ```
            
              
            This keeps the UI responsive while the mind keeps learning.

# Minimal Implementation Plan

- **Step 1: Schema additions**
    
    - Extend 
        
        pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py with 
        
        ```
        insights
        ```
        
        , 
        
        ```
        commitments
        ```
        
        , 
        
        ```
        evidence
        ```
        
        , 
        
        ```
        embeddings
        ```
        
         tables and CRUD helpers.
    - Keep hash-chaining for derived rows too (at least 
        
        ```
        insights
        ```
        
        , optional for others).
- **Step 2: Enrichment module**
    
    - New file 
        
        ```
        pmm/auto_enrich.py
        ```
        
         with:
        - ```
            extract_insights(text, event_id) -> list[dict]
            ```
            
             (structured)
        - ```
            extract_commitments(text, event_id) -> list[dict]
            ```
            
        - ```
            embed_object(object_type, object_id, text)
            ```
            
             using OpenAI embeddings
        - ```
            detect_evidence_for_open_commitments(recent_events) -> list[evidence]
            ```
            
        - ```
            process_new_events(store, llm, embedder, last_seen_id)
            ```
            
    - All functions add rows via the store and maintain provenance.
- **Step 3: Wire into chat**
    
    - In 
        
        chat.py’s 
        
        _persist_context, after 
        
        ```
        pmm_memory.save_context
        ```
        
        , call 
        
        ```
        auto_enrich.process_new_events(...)
        ```
        
         in the same background thread.
- **Step 4: Replace keyword “done” checks**
    
    - Remove/disable keyword-only closure logic.
    - Use embeddings + optional LLM confirm step for robust closure.

# Why this fixes your concern

- **No keyword guessing**: evidence is assessed semantically against content from both parties.
- **Always-on learning**: every event is embedded, distilled into insights, and cross-checked against commitments—without user commands.
- **Provenance & integrity**: everything links back to 
    
    events with hash-chained history, so the “mind” reasons over trustworthy state.
- **Performance-aware**: embeddings are cheap and can run asynchronously; LLM confirms can be batched or rate-limited.

# Next steps

- I can implement Step 1–3 in small PR-sized patches:
    - Add new tables and helpers in 
        
        pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py
    - Create 
        
        ```
        pmm/auto_enrich.py
        ```
        
         with the pipeline
    - Wire 
        
        chat.py to trigger enrichment after each turn
        
        Here are the main files that handle “thought” capture, persistence to the DB, and retrieval back into the model’s context.

- **chat.py**
    
    - Role: UI loop and orchestration.
    - Capture: Appends user/assistant turns to an in-memory 
        
        ```
        conversation_history
        ```
        
        .
    - Persistence trigger: After each model turn, calls 
        
        ```
        pmm_memory.save_context(...)
        ```
        
         in a background thread.
    - Retrieval: Before each AI response, refreshes the system message via 
        
        get_pmm_system_prompt() so the model sees fresh PMM state every turn.
- **`pmm/langchain_memory.py`**
    
    - Role: Adapter that bridges the chat flow and PMM persistence.
    - Capture: In 
        
        ```
        save_context()
        ```
        
        , logs user input and AI response as PMM events and “thoughts”.
    - Store: Writes to the append‑only ledger (via the store below), and runs commitment extraction/reflection hooks.
    - Retrieve: Implements 
        
        ```
        load_memory_variables()
        ```
        
         for LangChain-compatible history/context and helpers like 
        
        ```
        get_personality_summary()
        ```
        
        .
- **pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py**
    
    - Role: Database layer (SQLite WAL) with hash-chained, append‑only 
        
        events.
    - Store: Creates and maintains the 
        
        events table with columns like 
        
        ts, 
        
        ```
        kind
        ```
        
         (
        
        ```
        prompt|response|reflection|commitment|evidence
        ```
        
        ), 
        
        ```
        content
        ```
        
        , 
        
        ```
        meta
        ```
        
        , 
        
        ```
        prev_hash
        ```
        
        , 
        
        hash.
    - Integrity: New events link to the previous via 
        
        ```
        prev_hash
        ```
        
        →
        
        hash to make tampering evident.
    - Retrieve: Simple queries to read events (plus helpers like 
        
        latest_hash()).
- **`pmm/self_model_manager.py`**
    
    - Role: Higher-level “mind” logic.
    - Capture/derive: Generates insights/reflections from recent events, extracts commitments, and updates trait drift.
    - Retrieve: Summaries and state used to build the system prompt and probe outputs.
- **`pmm/reflection.py`**
    
    - Role: Turns raw events into insights (micro‑reflections).
    - Capture/derive: Produces structured “what was learned/thought” objects tied back to events for provenance.
- **`pmm/commitments.py`**
    
    - Role: Commitment lifecycle.
    - Capture/derive: Extracts “Next, I will …” actions from content and tracks them as open/closed with evidence.
- **`pmm/api/probe.py`**
    
     (read-only, optional)
    
    - Role: HTTP endpoints to retrieve current state (recent events, commitments, integrity checks) for dashboards/tools.

# Data flow (simplified)

chat.py → pmm/langchain_memory.save_context(...)  
        → pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py (append event + hash chain)  
        → pmm/self_model_manager.py (reflection, commitments, drift)  
        → retrieval:  
           - chat.py get_pmm_system_prompt() → pmm_memory.load_memory_variables()  
           - pmm/api/probe.py (optional) → read-only views

# Summary

- Capture happens in 
    
    chat.py + 
    
    ```
    pmm/langchain_memory.py
    ```
    
    .
- Storage is handled by 
    
    pmm/storage/sqlite_store.py (append-only, hash-chained).
- Retrieval for the model’s next turn is via 
    
    ```
    load_memory_variables()
    ```
    
     (in 
    
    ```
    pmm/langchain_memory.py
    ```
    
    ) and the refreshed system prompt in 
    
    chat.py.
- Derived “thoughts” (insights/reflections, commitments) are produced by 
    
    ```
    pmm/self_model_manager.py
    ```
    
     and 
    
    ```
    pmm/reflection.py
    ```
    
    , then persisted with provenance
