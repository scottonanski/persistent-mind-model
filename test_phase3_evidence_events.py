"""
Phase 3 Validation: Evidence Events Test

Tests the evidence event system that makes commitment closures auditable and real.

Acceptance Criteria (ChatGPT's Phase 3 spec):
- 100% of closed commitments have ≥1 linked `evidence:done`
- `commit_close_rate` in `/emergence` equals fraction with `evidence:done` (not acknowledgements)
- `/events/recent` shows three evidence kinds with correct `commit_ref` hash round-trip
- Auto-closure never fires without an evidence row
