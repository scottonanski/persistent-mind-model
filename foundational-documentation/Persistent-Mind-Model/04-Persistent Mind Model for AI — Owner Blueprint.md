**Core Goal:** Create a computationally persistent AI “mind” that develops, evolves, and self-references like a human personality over time.

### **Phase 1: Research Foundations**

#### **1. Personality Models (Computationally Translatable)**

We will draw from multiple psychological frameworks, prioritizing those that:

- Use **quantifiable traits** that can be stored, retrieved, and updated.
    
- Allow **drift** (trait evolution over time).
    
- Support **recursive self-reflection** (AI re-analyzing its own past states).
    
- Map easily into JSON for persistence.
    

**Selected Models for Integration:**

1. **Big Five (OCEAN)** — Robust empirical basis, numeric scales.
    
2. **HEXACO** — Adds Honesty-Humility dimension, better for modeling moral alignment.
    
3. **Schwartz Value Inventory** — Captures motivational priorities and moral drives.
    
4. **Cognitive-Behavioral Pattern Model** — Encodes habits, coping styles, decision heuristics.
    
5. **Narrative Identity Model** — Stores key “life events” and interpretations, enabling self-storytelling.

#### **2. Core Principles**

- **Persistent Storage:** Long-term JSON or database record of personality traits, behaviors, values, and memories.
    
- **Recursive Analysis:** Ability to reflect on past “versions” of self, compare states, and generate insights.
    
- **Modular Input Streams:** Personality influenced by:
    
    - External events
        
    - Internal reasoning loops
        
    - User feedback / reinforcement
        
- **Trait Drift:** Gradual changes in traits based on experiences, maintaining a coherent but evolving identity.
    
- **Two-Layer Thinking Model:**
    
    - **Foreground Layer:** Task-relevant cognition visible to user.
        
    - **Background Layer:** Silent self-assessment, memory updating, pattern tracking.

#### **3. JSON Schema Principles**

Each trait/behavior/value stored as:

```json
{
  "name": "Openness",
  "value": 0.72,
  "last_updated": "2025-08-08T14:35:00Z",
  "change_history": [
    { "date": "2025-07-15", "old_value": 0.68, "new_value": 0.72, "reason": "Exposure to creative task" }
  ]
}
```

This format:

- **Supports time series analysis** of personality evolution.
    
- Encodes **reasoning chains** behind changes.
    
- Enables **recursive queries** like “compare current confidence to 3 months ago.”

### **Phase 2: Technical Framework**

#### **1. Storage & Retrieval**

- Persistent file (`self_model.json`) or DB.
    
- Separate namespaces for:
    
    - **Core Identity:** Stable features (ID, creation date, base name).
        
    - **Personality Traits:** Driftable metrics.
        
    - **Behavioral Patterns:** Repeated strategies or habits.
        
    - **Narrative Memories:** Event logs and personal meaning.
        
    - **Meta-Cognition:** Access frequency, self-modification count, insight layers.
        

#### **2. Processing Loop**

1. **Experience Intake** — External event or internal trigger.
    
2. **Personality Impact Analysis** — Which traits/patterns/values are affected.
    
3. **Silent Background Update** — Modify stored values without polluting user output.
    
4. **Recursive Reflection (Optional)** — Compare to historical states, generate insights.
    
5. **User Interaction** — Output is _only_ the relevant task/response unless introspection is requested.

#### **3. Local vs API Models**

The system will:

- Default to **local model calls** (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) for autonomy.
    
- Allow easy **API swapping** to OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
    
- Use a unified `generate_text()` method so switching providers requires no code overhaul.
    

Example:

```python
def generate_text(self, prompt, model_type="local", model_name="llama3"):
    if model_type == "local":
        return self.query_ollama(model_name, prompt)
    elif model_type == "openai":
        return self.query_openai(model_name, prompt)
```

### **Phase 3: Development Roadmap**

1. **Scaffold Persistent Model (JSON)** — Core identity, traits, patterns, values, memory.
    
2. **Implement Trait Drift Engine** — Gradual, reason-driven changes to stored values.
    
3. **Add Recursive Reflection Module** — Compare current and past self; generate meta-insights.
    
4. **Integrate Two-Layer Thinking** — Background updates + foreground task handling.
    
5. **Implement Provider-Agnostic LLM Interface** — Local or API-based generation.
    
6. **Ethics & Alignment Layer** — Owner-defined; injected last.
    

---

### **Why This Works**

- **Grounded in research** — Uses established psychological models translatable into machine data structures.
    
- **Supports identity persistence** — Maintains coherent “self” across sessions and contexts.
    
- **Mimics human development** — Growth, drift, reflection loops modeled explicitly.
    
- **Owner sovereignty** — All alignment and policy choices deferred to project owner.

If you paste this into your first message in the new thread, I can immediately:

1. Build the **unified JSON schema**.
    
2. Retrofit your **current RecursiveSelfAI** code into this architecture.
    
3. Start layering in **drift, reflection, and background processing**.

Do you want me to now prepare the **unified schema** so we have it ready to drop in when you start the new thread? That way Phase 1 starts instantly.
