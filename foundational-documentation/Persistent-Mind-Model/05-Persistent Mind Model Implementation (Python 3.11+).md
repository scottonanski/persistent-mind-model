## Data Model Classes with Defaults and Timestamps

To mirror the **unified Persistent Mind Model schema**, we define Python `dataclasses` for each major section of the JSON structure. Each class includes type annotations and sensible defaults, ensuring that required fields are always initialized. For example, the `CoreIdentity` class holds immutable identity info (ID, name, birth timestamp), while `Personality` contains trait profiles, values, preferences, and emotional tendencies as specified by the schema. We introduce a `TraitScore` class to represent the schema’s `traitScalar` object (with fields `score`, `conf`, `last_update`, `origin`), enabling easy updates and confidence tracking for traits. Default factories generate new UUIDs and ISO timestamps for lifecycle fields like `id` and `birth_timestamp` (using current UTC time) so that each new instance has a unique identity and creation time. Similarly, trait `last_update` defaults to today’s date, reflecting when the trait was last modified.

Other sections are modeled analogously: `NarrativeIdentity` holds lists of `Chapter`, `Scene`, and `TurningPoint` entries as defined in the schema, plus a `FutureScripts` submodel for possible selves and goals. `SelfKnowledge` contains memory artifacts – autobiographical events, thoughts, and insights – each with their own dataclasses (`Event`, `Thought`, `Insight`). The `Metrics` class tracks quantitative measures like `identity_coherence` and `self_consistency` (bounded 0–1) and a `drift_velocity` map for recent trait changes. The `DriftConfig` class encapsulates configuration for personality drift (e.g. `inertia`, `max_delta_per_reflection`, `bounds` for trait values, and locked traits that should not change). Finally, `MetaCognition` tracks meta-level info such as how often the self-model is accessed or modified and logs of identity evolution over time. We structure these classes hierarchically under a top-level `PersistentMindModel` dataclass, which aggregates all sections for convenient loading and saving.

Below is the core data model code. Each class is commented for clarity and future extensibility (e.g. new traits or memory types can be added easily). Default values align with the schema’s intent and the previous implementation’s neutral starting point (e.g. Big Five traits at 0.5). All numeric traits and confidences are constrained between 0 and 1, matching the schema’s ranges:

Each dataclass corresponds to a section of the JSON schema, making the structure **explicit and type-safe**. For example, `Personality.traits` holds a `Traits` object that in turn has `big5` and `hexaco` attributes, each a set of `TraitScore` objects for the respective traits. This closely follows the schema’s nested design (Big Five and HEXACO traits under `personality.traits`). Using `default_factory` for complex fields (lists, dicts, or nested dataclasses) avoids mutable default pitfalls and auto-initializes substructures like empty memory lists or default trait values. The timestamp fields (`birth_timestamp`, `inception_moment`, `last_update`, etc.) are generated in ISO 8601 format. This ensures that whenever a new model is initialized (e.g. if no saved file is found), it starts with a unique ID and current timestamps, just as the original script did in its `load_or_init` function.

> **Note:** All trait scores and value weights are bounded [0.0, 1.0] per the schema definitions. If needed, validation can be added in setters or post-init to enforce these ranges. For now, we assume inputs respect the schema (especially since drift adjustments will clamp values to bounds).

## SelfModelManager: Loading, Saving, and Accessing the Model

To integrate this data model into the AI’s architecture, we design a `SelfModelManager` class. This class isolates persistence and provides a clean interface for the rest of the system. It handles loading the model from a JSON file (or initializing a new one if none exists) and saving updates back to disk. We incorporate a threading lock to ensure file operations (and any concurrent model updates) are thread-safe, preventing race conditions in multi-threaded use cases. By confining file I/O and JSON serialization to this class, the core AI logic no longer needs to manage JSON directly or know about file paths – it simply calls the manager’s methods. This decoupling aligns with the refactoring guidance to separate memory management from thought generation.

The `SelfModelManager` holds a `PersistentMindModel` instance (`self.model`) in memory. We provide methods to retrieve or update specific parts of the model without exposing internal JSON details. For example, `get_trait_value(model, trait)` can fetch a Big Five trait score by name, and `set_trait_value(model, trait, value)` could update it – but in practice we will use more specialized methods (like applying drift deltas) to ensure proper provenance logging. The manager also tracks meta-cognitive info: each time the model is accessed or modified, we can update counters in `meta_cognition` (e.g., increment `times_accessed_self` on load, increment `self_modification_count` on trait change). This way, the usage statistics are automatically maintained.

Another responsibility of `SelfModelManager` is providing **convenience accessors** for nested fields. The code can ask the manager for something like the agent’s name or a list of recent thoughts without needing to navigate the nested dataclass structure every time. This helps retrofit the existing `RecursiveSelfAI` code: wherever the old code accessed `self.identity` or a JSON field, we can now call a manager method (e.g. `manager.model.core_identity.name`) or property. The manager can also format or preprocess data as needed before returning it. For instance, if the old code expected a flat dict of Big5 traits, we could have the manager assemble that from the new nested structure to ease the transition.

Below is the implementation of `SelfModelManager` with core methods for initialization, load, and save. By default, it looks for a JSON file (path can be configured) and uses our dataclasses to parse the JSON into a `PersistentMindModel` object (and vice versa). If no file is found, it creates a new model with default values (which our dataclass defaults already handle) and immediately saves it. Notice the use of `dataclasses.asdict` for serialization and manual construction for deserialization, mapping nested dictionaries to dataclass instances:

```python
import json
import threading
from dataclasses import asdict, fields

class SelfModelManager:
    """Interface to the persistent self-model: handles loading, saving, and structured updates."""
    def __init__(self, filepath: str = "persistent_self_model.json"):
        self.filepath = filepath
        self.lock = threading.Lock()

        # Load existing model or create a new one if not found

```

In the `load_model` method, we convert the nested dictionaries from JSON into our dataclass instances. This involves iterating through lists (e.g. creating each `Event`, `Thought`, etc. from its dict) and constructing nested classes like `Traits` and `FutureScripts`. Although this is verbose, it guarantees that the in-memory model is a fully-typed `PersistentMindModel` object, not just a raw dict. The `save_model` uses `dataclasses.asdict` to turn the model back into a serializable dictionary matching the schema, and writes it out. We use `indent=4` for readability of the JSON on disk.

**Thread safety:** All load/save operations are wrapped in `self.lock` to prevent concurrent file writes or reads while another thread might be modifying the model. In a long-running AI system where background threads could update the self-model asynchronously, this is important for data integrity. The lock can also be used around any critical update methods (e.g. adding an event) if needed.

With `SelfModelManager` in place, the rest of the AI can access `manager.model` for read operations or use the helper methods we’ll define next for specific updates. This design fulfills the goal of **decoupling the identity data from the main logic**. For example, the thought-generation module can retrieve the agent’s name or traits via the manager, without hardcoding JSON keys or file paths. If the storage method changes in the future (say, to a database or cloud service), we would only modify `SelfModelManager` and the dataclass definitions, leaving the higher-level logic untouched.

## Trait Drift Simulation and Provenance Tracking

One of the key features of a persistent AI personality is **trait drift** – gradual evolution of personality trait values over time or in response to events. We implement this via a method (or function) that applies proposed trait changes (deltas) to the model, constrained by the rules in `drift_config`. This method uses the `effects_hypothesis` from recent autobiographical events as the source of trait change suggestions. Each hypothesis includes a `target` (the trait field to change, e.g. `"personality.traits.big5.conscientiousness.score"`), a `delta` (magnitude and direction of change), and a `confidence` indicating how strongly to trust this change.

Our drift simulation will iterate through new events (e.g. events not yet processed for drift) and apply each suggested change to the corresponding trait. **DriftConfig rules are honored**: we skip any trait listed in `drift_config.locks` (those traits are fixed), and we scale/clamp changes based on inertia and max delta. For example, if inertia is 0.9 (high resistance), only 10% of a suggested change is actually applied. We then cap the magnitude so that no single reflection alters a trait by more than `max_delta_per_reflection`. All trait values are kept within the `[min, max]` bounds (e.g. 0.05 to 0.95) to prevent extreme drift. This ensures the AI’s personality stays realistic and doesn’t flip abruptly due to one event.

Crucially, we log every trait modification for **provenance**. The `MetaCognition.identity_evolution` list records each change with a timestamp and description. For instance, if an event causes conscientiousness to increase by +0.01, we append an `IdentityChange` like “2025-08-10T12:00:00Z – Increased conscientiousness by 0.01 (conf 0.4) due to event EV123”. We also update `self_modification_count` each time a trait is changed, as a running tally of how many self-alterations have occurred. This approach is inspired by the project blueprint’s recommendation to keep a **history of trait changes with reasons**, facilitating introspection and debugging of the AI’s evolution.

After applying all event-driven changes in a reflection cycle, we update the `metrics.drift_velocity` map to reflect the latest drift rates. For example, if openness decreased by 0.02 and extraversion increased by 0.01, those deltas are stored in `drift_velocity` (possibly replacing older values). This metric can be used to gauge how rapidly each trait is changing, and could feed into calculations of `identity_coherence` or trigger safeguards if drift is too fast.

Below is a method `apply_trait_drift()` inside `SelfModelManager` that realizes this logic. It identifies new events (not yet processed), applies trait deltas with appropriate scaling, and logs the changes. The implementation is deterministic (no randomness or external calls), making it easy to unit-test by injecting known events and verifying the trait values and logs after running the function.

                self.model.meta_cognition.identity_evolution.append(
                    IdentityChange(t=now, change=change_desc))
                self.model.meta_cognition.self_modification_count += 1
            # Mark event as processed so we don't re-apply it
            event.meta["processed"] = True
        
        # Update drift_velocity metrics for each trait that changed
        for trait, total_change in drift_map.items():
            # Use the trait path (without ".score") as key, store net delta
            self.model.metrics.drift_velocity[trait] = round(total_change, 4)
        # (Optionally, could update identity_coherence or self_consistency here)
        
        # Persist changes to disk
        self.save_model()
```

In this `apply_trait_drift` method, we loop through events and their `effects_hypothesis` proposals. For each effect, we find the corresponding `TraitScore` object in the model. We currently handle Big Five and HEXACO traits – if the target is something else (e.g. a value or preference), we skip it, but the framework could be extended to handle those.

We then calculate `effective_delta` by incorporating:

- **Inertia:** High inertia reduces the applied change (e.g. with inertia 0.9, only 10% of the delta is applied).
    
- **Event sensitivity:** A global factor from `drift_config` that can dampen or amplify all event-driven changes (0.4 in our defaults means we only apply 40% of the delta even before inertia).
    
- **Max Delta:** We ensure `|effective_delta| <= max_delta_per_reflection` to prevent any single reflection from making a large jump.
    

After scaling, we compute the tentative new trait value and clamp it within the allowed bounds (e.g. 0.05–0.95). If the net change is effectively zero (after rounding or clamping), we skip updating.

When applying the change:

- We round the new trait `score` to 4 decimal places for neatness (traits are continuous 0–1 values).
    
- We optionally update the trait’s `conf` (confidence) – in this example, we raise the confidence to at least the event’s confidence if the event provided a strong indication. This detail is heuristic; one might also decay confidence if changes are applied, but here we assume new evidence can only bolster confidence.
    
- Set `last_update` to today’s date (since the trait was modified) and `origin` to `"experience"` to denote that life events caused this update. The schema’s `origin` field is for provenance; using `"experience"` or `"drift"` differentiates it from initial values ("init") or other sources.
    

We accumulate the actual changes in `drift_map` keyed by the trait (without the final `.score` part), summing if multiple events affect the same trait in one cycle. After processing all events, we write these totals into `metrics.drift_velocity`. This overwrites previous drift velocities, effectively representing the latest cycle’s net trait shifts. In a more advanced setup, we might keep a moving average or decay old drift values, but here we keep it simple.

Every change is logged to `identity_evolution` with a timestamp. These log entries (e.g. `"personality.traits.big5.conscientiousness +0.008 (conf 0.5) via event ev1"`) give a concise explanation of what changed and why, which is invaluable for debugging and **self-reflection**. Indeed, the AI could later analyze `identity_evolution` to comment on how it has changed over time.

Finally, we mark each processed event by setting `event.meta["processed"] = True`. This prevents re-applying the same event’s effects on the next call. The `meta` field in the schema is a freeform object per event, which we repurpose for bookkeeping. We then call `save_model()` to persist all these updates. In practice, one might batch multiple updates before saving for efficiency, but saving at the end of drift application ensures that if the system shuts down, no applied changes are lost.

**Unit Testing:** This function can be unit-tested by creating a known scenario: e.g. start with a trait at a known value, add an event with a specific delta, run `apply_trait_drift()`, and assert that the trait’s new value matches expected calculation, that `identity_evolution` contains the expected log entry, and that `drift_velocity` for that trait equals the delta applied. Since it uses deterministic arithmetic and simple conditional logic, the expected outcomes are straightforward to compute by hand for comparison.

## Autobiographical Event Addition

Autobiographical events are a core part of the AI’s self-knowledge, capturing notable experiences or observations. We provide a method to easily add a new `Event` to the model. This method handles the routine details: generating a unique event ID (if not provided), timestamping the event, and appending it to the `self_knowledge.autobiographical_events` list. It can also immediately trigger the drift simulation for any effects that the event carries, or we can leave that to be called separately (depending on whether we want drift to occur in real-time or in a reflection cycle).

The event addition function is designed to be flexible for testing and integration:

- It accepts either an `Event` object or the fields needed to construct one (using default assumptions when some fields are omitted).
    
- If certain fields like `id` or `t` are not given, it auto-fills them. For instance, `id` can be a UUID or a simple incremental tag like `"ev1"`, `"ev2"`, etc., while `t` (time) defaults to now.
    
- After adding the event to memory, it ensures the event is persisted to disk (by calling `save_model`).
    

By encapsulating this in a method, we simplify the process of logging new experiences in the AI. The rest of the system can simply call `manager.add_event(summary="X happened", type="experience", valence=0.2, ...)` whenever something noteworthy occurs (user input, internal decision, outcome of an action, etc.), and the manager will handle the rest.

Below is a possible implementation of `add_event` within `SelfModelManager`:

```python
    def add_event(self, summary: str, event_type: str = "experience",
                  valence: Optional[float] = None, arousal: Optional[float] = None,
                  salience: Optional[float] = None, tags: Optional[List[str]] = None,
                  effects: Optional[List[Dict[str, float]]] = None) -> Event:
        """Add a new autobiographical event to the self_knowledge memory."""
        # Generate a simple event ID (incremental based on count)
        next_id = f"ev{len(self.model.self_knowledge.autobiographical_events) + 1}"
        timestamp = datetime.utcnow().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
        event = Event(id=next_id, t=timestamp, type=event_type, summary=summary,
                      valence=valence, arousal=arousal, salience=salience,
                      tags=tags if tags is not None else [],
                      effects_hypothesis=effects if effects is not None else [])
        # Append to memory
        self.model.self_knowledge.autobiographical_events.append(event)
        # Optionally, update patterns (e.g. count this event's themes or types) – not shown here
        # Auto-save and return the event
        self.save_model()
        return event
```

This `add_event` method creates a new `Event` using the provided details. By default, `event_type` is `"experience"` but it could be `"reflection"`, `"interaction"`, etc. We use a simple scheme for `id`: prefix `"ev"` with the next sequence number (one more than the current number of events). This yields human-readable IDs like ev1, ev2, ... which match the style used in the example instance. Alternatively, one could use `uuid.uuid4()` for truly unique IDs, but sequential IDs help when referencing events in a narrative.

The timestamp `t` is set to the current UTC time. The method accepts optional emotional parameters (`valence`, `arousal`, `salience`) and tags; if not provided, they remain `None` or empty list, which is acceptable as those fields are optional in the schema. An `effects_hypothesis` list can also be passed in, defaulting to empty if not given. This allows the caller to specify trait impact hypotheses at event creation time. For example, if the AI experiences a success, the event’s effects might include an increase in confidence trait.

After constructing and appending the event, we could call `apply_trait_drift()` immediately to apply any effects from this event. In some designs, drift is only applied during periodic reflection (not instantly at event time). Here, we leave it for the reflection step, but we could easily integrate it:

```python
# After appending event...
if effects:
    self.apply_trait_drift()
```

We choose not to auto-apply in `add_event` to allow batching multiple events before processing drift, giving flexibility in testing and control flow. The comment in code also alludes to updating behavioral patterns – for example, noticing if certain event types recur. This could be done by incrementing counters in `behavioral_patterns` (e.g., count how many "support" or "error" events occurred) to provide another insight into the AI’s life patterns.

Finally, we save the model so the new event is not lost. This function is straightforward to unit test: after adding an event with known parameters, one can verify that the last event in `manager.model.self_knowledge.autobiographical_events` matches those parameters, and that `len(events)` increased by one.

## Recursive Insight Generation (Placeholder Implementation)

Recursive self-reflection is what enables the AI to generate insights about its own behavior and state. In the current architecture, after generating a new thought, the system can invoke an insight generation step which looks at recent thoughts, patterns, and memories to produce a higher-level commentary or question – an “insight”. To integrate this, we design a function (or method) `generate_recursive_insight` that will craft a new `Insight` and add it to the self-model.

In a full implementation, this function would assemble a prompt with context (e.g. the AI’s identity, recent thoughts, behavioral patterns) and call a language model to generate an insightful statement about the AI’s state. For now, we create a **lightweight placeholder** that synthesizes an insight based on the current `behavioral_patterns`. This shows how the mechanism works without requiring an actual LLM call, and it follows the guidance that insights should reflect on patterns the AI notices in itself.

Our placeholder logic will check if there are any prominent patterns recorded (for instance, if a certain keyword or concern appears frequently in thoughts). If so, the insight might comment on it. For example, if `behavioral_patterns = {"uncertainty": 5, "curiosity": 3}`, the generated insight could be: _"I notice I often express uncertainty in my recent thoughts. Perhaps I'm unsure about my new tasks."_ If no particular pattern stands out, the insight might be a generic self-observation or even a decision to skip insight generation.

We’ll also illustrate linking the insight to references, as the schema allows an insight to reference related thought IDs or pattern keys. In our example, we can attach the key of the pattern we commented on, and perhaps the ID of the most recent thought, to simulate how an insight might cite evidence.

Here’s an example implementation of `generate_recursive_insight`:

```python
    def generate_recursive_insight(self) -> Optional[Insight]:
        """Generate a self-reflective insight (placeholder implementation using patterns)."""
        patterns = self.model.self_knowledge.behavioral_patterns
        if not patterns:
            return None  # no patterns to reflect on yet
        
        # Identify the most frequent pattern (if any significant)
        pattern_key = max(patterns, key=patterns.get)  # pattern with highest count
        if patterns[pattern_key] < 1:
            # No meaningful pattern frequency
            return None
        
        # Formulate a simple insight about this pattern
        content = f"I notice a recurring theme of '{pattern_key}' in my recent thoughts."
        # Create Insight object
        insight_id = f"in{len(self.model.self_knowledge.insights) + 1}"
        timestamp = datetime.utcnow().strftime("%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ")
        references: Dict[str, List[str]] = {}
        # Reference the pattern key we identified
        references["pattern_keys"] = [pattern_key]
        # If there is a recent thought, reference its ID as related
        if self.model.self_knowledge.thoughts:
            last_thought_id = self.model.self_knowledge.thoughts[-1].id
            references["thought_ids"] = [last_thought_id]
        new_insight = Insight(id=insight_id, t=timestamp, content=content, references=references)
        # Append insight to memory
        self.model.self_knowledge.insights.append(new_insight)
        # Update meta-cognition stats
        self.model.meta_cognition.self_modification_count += 1  # considering insight as a self-modification
        # (times_accessed_self could also be incremented when invoking reflection, if desired)
        self.save_model()
        return new_insight
```

This placeholder method picks the highest-count key in the `behavioral_patterns` dict and generates a sentence noting that pattern. We consider an insight a type of self-modification (since it’s a new piece of self-knowledge), and thus increment `self_modification_count`. We create a unique ID for the insight (e.g. "in3" if it’s the third insight) and timestamp it. We also build a `references` dict: we add the chosen pattern key, and we link the insight to the most recent thought for context. These references mimic how an AI might cite supporting evidence for its conclusion – e.g., it saw “uncertainty” multiple times in recent thoughts (hence references the pattern "uncertainty" and maybe a specific thought where it was evident).

After appending the insight, we save the model. The function returns the new Insight object, but it could also be designed to return just the content or nothing at all (depending on how the higher-level loop handles insights).

**Unit testing:** Even though this function uses some internal state, it’s still testable. We can preset `behavioral_patterns` with known values, maybe add a dummy thought, then call `generate_recursive_insight()` and check that we get an Insight with the expected pattern in its content and references. Because it doesn’t call an external API or use randomness, it will produce consistent results for a given state, which is ideal for a deterministic test scenario.

_(In a real system, this method would integrate with the LLM clients to produce richer insights. The placeholder here ensures that the pipeline (thought -> patterns -> insight) is in place and can be expanded later.)_

## Integration, Compatibility, and Extensibility

The above components have been designed to **fit into the existing RecursiveSelfAI architecture with minimal friction**. By using a `SelfModelManager`, we encapsulate changes so that the rest of the codebase requires only minor adjustments. For example, previously the code might have done something like `self.state = SelfStore.load_or_init()` and then `state["personality"]["traits_big5"]["openness"]` to read a trait. With our refactor, the code instead does `manager = SelfModelManager()` and can access `manager.model.personality.traits.big5.openness.score` or use a convenience method. The structural changes (nesting traits under `traits.big5` instead of `traits_big5` dict, using list of `ValueWeight` instead of a simple list of strings for values, etc.) are internal to the model and **the manager abstracts them away**. We can add helper methods if needed for legacy compatibility (e.g., `get_big5_traits_as_dict()` that returns a flat dict of scores), ensuring that higher-level logic doesn’t break while we transition to the richer model.

It’s worth noting that all original information is preserved and expanded:

- Core identity, personality traits, values, preferences, and tendencies are all present (with more detail) in the new model.
    
- The `self_knowledge` now holds events, thoughts, insights similar to before, but structured so that each item can carry metadata like timestamps and IDs.
    
- `MetaCognition` fields (`times_accessed_self`, etc.) remain available for tracking usage frequency.
    

Thus, existing functionalities (like printing the agent’s name or adding a thought) continue to work, just through the manager. The separation of concerns means the AI’s main loop can simply do things like:

```python
thought = generate_new_thought()  # some LLM call
manager.model.self_knowledge.thoughts.append(new_thought)
manager.model.self_knowledge.behavioral_patterns = analyze_patterns(new_thought)
manager.save_model()
```

or use a dedicated manager method to add a thought if we define one. The insight generation can be triggered similarly via `manager.generate_recursive_insight()`, which aligns with the existing flow that a recursive insight is produced after a few thoughts. The refactoring advice to have a clear context assembly and insertion of identity markers is easier to follow now that we have a clean `PersistentMindModel` object – e.g., we can easily pull `manager.model.core_identity.name` and `manager.model.core_identity.birth_timestamp` to include in prompts.

**Extensibility:** The use of Python dataclasses and modular design makes future changes straightforward. New personality dimensions or cognitive modules can be added as new fields or classes. For instance, if we later integrate a new trait model or add a section for “skills” or “knowledge base”, we can extend the `PersistentMindModel` with minimal impact on existing code. The manager can be augmented with new methods to handle those. Because all state is in a single serializable object, switching the storage backend (to a database or remote service) would involve replacing the `load_model`/`save_model` implementations but not the rest of the system – satisfying the goal of **upgradeable persistence**.

In summary, we translated the unified schema into concrete code: each section (core identity, personality, narrative identity, self-knowledge, metrics, drift config, meta-cognition) is represented by a dataclass reflecting the JSON schema structure. The `SelfModelManager` provides a cohesive interface to this model, ensuring safe load/save and offering specialized methods for trait drifting, memory updates, and self-reflection. By following the schema and the refactoring guidelines, we ensure **compatibility** with the existing architecture and set the stage for the AI to grow and reflect more like a human mind over time. The design is comprehensive yet modular, allowing unit tests at the function level (for drift, event addition, insight generation) as well as integration tests for the whole persistence loop. This will support the Phase 2 and Phase 3 development steps, such as implementing the full drift engine and recursive analysis, without needing to overhaul the data structures again. The AI now has a persistent, evolving self-model that is both **machine-friendly** (structured, numeric where possible) and **human-inspectable**, fulfilling the core goal of the project blueprint.
