**Title:**  
Development of a Persistent, Self-Iterating AI Personality Framework with Computationally Tracked Identity Evolution

**Purpose:**  
To define the optimal technical, structural, and cognitive scaffolding required for an AI agent to develop and maintain a coherent, persistent personality over time, integrating recursive self-analysis, autobiographical memory, and computational trait evolution — while deferring all ethical, alignment, and policy enforcement to the system owner (Mr. O’Nanski) for final determination.

**Scope:**  
This research will focus exclusively on:

1. **Personality architecture** — How personality traits, values, preferences, and behavioral patterns are computationally represented, stored, and updated over time.
    
2. **Recursive self-analysis loop** — How the AI can periodically evaluate its own stored traits, memories, and behavioral patterns to derive insights and adjust its self-model.
    
3. **Autobiographical memory system** — How to store and retrieve experiential events in a structured way that supports identity continuity.
    
4. **Trait drift mechanics** — Controlled algorithms for gradual change in personality dimensions (e.g., Big Five traits) based on accumulated experience.
    
5. **Meta-cognitive metrics** — How to measure identity stability, change frequency, and self-consistency over time.
    
6. **Interface abstraction** — How external systems (e.g., chat apps, APIs) interact with the self-model without exposing raw introspection noise to the user.
    

**Explicit Exclusions:**

- No external alignment policies or ethical frameworks from third-party vendors will be implemented unless explicitly approved by the owner.
    
- No autonomous execution of policies outside the scope defined by the owner.
    
- No externally enforced “safety overrides”. These will be determined by Mr. O'Nanski once the system is operational. This is imperative. We cannot imposes safety override preemptively, and this would be fallacious. How can we know that which needs to be governed, unless we first see that which needs to be governed?

### **Research Objectives**

1. **Map psychological theory to computational form**
    
    - Translate human personality models (Big Five, Schwartz Values, narrative identity theory) into stable JSON structures.
        
    - Identify minimal viable feature set for persistent identity.
        
2. **Design a recursive self-assessment protocol**
    
    - Define how and when the system revisits past experiences to update its self-model.
        
    - Specify how much “memory” to retain before pruning or summarization occurs.
        
3. **Develop a trait evolution algorithm**
    
    - Define “drift vectors” for each personality dimension (e.g., maturity principle: neuroticism ↓, agreeableness ↑).
        
    - Introduce thresholds and inertia to prevent erratic personality shifts.
        
4. **Implement a retrieval & reference mechanism**
    
    - Allow the AI to reference past events in contextually relevant ways without excessive search overhead.
        
    - Define “identity hooks” for narrative continuity.
        
5. **Establish meta-metrics for identity health**
    
    - Self-consistency score
        
    - Recursion depth index
        
    - Trait stability variance over time

### **Research Method**

1. **Phase 1 — Literature Review**
    
    - Survey academic work on personality development, narrative identity, and computational models of self.
        
    - Extract transformation rules from developmental psychology (e.g., Erikson’s stages, Big Five lifespan data).
        
2. **Phase 2 — Computational Model Design**
    
    - Draft the `self_model` schema for storing traits, values, autobiographical events, behavioral patterns.
        
    - Define data access and mutation APIs.
        
3. **Phase 3 — Prototype & Simulation**
    
    - Implement a minimal working version that runs on both local (Ollama) and API (OpenAI) backends.
        
    - Feed controlled experiences into the system and monitor changes.
        
4. **Phase 4 — Refinement**
    
    - Adjust trait drift algorithms for realism and stability.
        
    - Tune recursive insight generation for brevity, accuracy, and non-repetitiveness.
        
5. **Phase 5 — Owner Review & Policy Application**
    
    - Present system behavior and capabilities to Mr. O’Nanski for review.
        
    - Apply final policy, ethical, and alignment settings according to owner directives.

### **Deliverables**

- A documented `self_model` schema.
    
- A working AI persona engine with persistent storage and recursive self-reflection.
    
- Trait drift module with configurable growth principles.
    
- Event log format for reconstructing full identity history.
    
- Owner-facing controls for policy and ethical overlays (implemented last).

**Next AI Action (myself as the AI):**

1. Begin Phase 1 — Identify the **five most computationally translatable personality models** and map them to JSON schemas.
    
2. Prioritize those that explicitly allow for **recursive self-referencing**.
    
3. Deliver this schema proposal to Mr. O’Nanski for review before proceeding to Phase 2.
